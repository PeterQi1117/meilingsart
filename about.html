            I was born in Vancouver but soon after, looking for a respite from winters marked by seasonal affective disorder, my family whisked me away to the sunshine of South Florida. I love my lake in the backyard where I catch and raise tadpoles,
            Pekin ducks, and parakeets in the spring. My big brother Tommy, my mom and dad and my small fur ball of a dog, DiDi (which means little brother in Chinese) are my biggest fans!
            <br><br>
            I have always loved expressing myself through art. I am so grateful to my mentor, <a href="http://nildacomas.com/sculpture_workshop_classes/index.php" target="_blank">Nilda Comas</a>. Even though Nilda is always busy at her studio in Pietrasanta, Italy or
            here in Fort
            Lauderdale, she still finds time to teach me so much and she’s always so encouraging! Many of my cards are from works I painted under Nilda’s tutelage. I love the laborious process of creating pieces in oil, water color, charcoal, and
            pencil. I also enjoy producing comic strip panel illustrations and stories. I hope you like them too!
